# Challenge List List Points Calculator
**The website of the Challenge List is currently bugged.**

The Stats Viewer is displaying the *wrong* amount of List Points. This is because of an error in the code of the website that is very difficult to resolve. 

## How to use

**If you want to check how many List Points you really have**
- Go to the [releases](https://releases.com) and download *points.exe* .
- Next to to the [challenge List website](https://challengelist.gd) and open the Stats Viewer. 
- Open the application and keep it somewhere where you can easily get to it again.
- Look up what main list challenges you have beaten by scrolling to the top of the site and clicking on *Main List*, the whole list will drop down and cover your stats viewer profile, but as soon as you start typing the name of a challenge it will get significantly smaller and allow you to see both the position of the challenge and your stats viewer profile. 
- Enter the **position** of the challenge into the application and hit enter
- Repeat this until you've gone over all the mainlists's you have beaten.

If your *true* amount of List Points is over 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000 or 5000 and you do *not* have the corresponding roles in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6348PP35Fq), then post a screenshot of your stats viewer profile and attach a message saying what role(s) you miss.

If you are still afraid of malware you can also clone this repository and build the application yourself, you do need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed and set up.
